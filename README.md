# HACKNOVATE-2024
Our purpose is to link traditonal knowledge and modern technology to provide everyone a chance to explore the marvels of cosmos
Intricate use of machine learning algorithms to recongnize the patterns of stars through the captured features.

Connecting the recognition system to a databse of known constellations.

Keeping all the necessary parameters into the consideration, the end results will be an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.
Creating a mobile app for on-the-go constellation identification.
Augmented Reality Integration:
Incorporating AR technology for immersive stargazing experiences.
Community Engagement.
Building a platform for users to share their observations and contribute to the project.
Successfully developed a system for identifying star constellations.
Empowering individuals to explore and appreciate the beauty of the night sky.
